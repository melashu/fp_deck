# ðŸ“– FP Deck <a name="fp-deck"></a>

I built FP Deck based on the Figma design, but I have added some features like dark theme support, user authentication, and responsiveness. 

## Demo Video <a name="demo-video"></a>

## Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
My development of FP Deck involved these technologies.
 - Ruby on Rails (as the backend framework)
 - PostgreSQL (for the database)
 - CSS and Tailwind CSS (for styling the webpage)
 - Stimulus (to write custom frontend logic)
 - Turbo (to display changes without page refresh)
 - ViewComponent (to create reusable view components)
 - RSpec and Capybara (for testing)

### Feature Improvement <a name="features-improvement"></a>

In the feature I would like to add the following features

- Improving design for pagination 
- Implementing exporting data (to csv, xml or json)
